          <strong>By:</strong> Arthur Calvi (Intern at Kayrros, supervised by Aurélien De Truchis, 2022)
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction &amp; Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          In 2022, I joined <strong>Kayrros</strong> as an intern under the supervision of 
          <em>Aurélien De Truchis</em> with a mission: adapt and enhance the 
          <em>Google Dynamic World</em> approach for robust, high-resolution land use and 
          land cover classification. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Google Dynamic World</strong> is an AI-driven, 10 m resolution, near real-time 
          land cover dataset that categorizes Earth into nine classes: 
          <em>Water, Trees, Grass, Crops, Shrub &amp; Scrub, Flooded Vegetation, Built-Up Area, 
          Bare Ground, and Snow &amp; Ice</em>. While Dynamic World is already remarkable, 
          it sometimes struggles with temporal consistency and certain niche environments. 
          My work at Kayrros aimed at making a lightweight yet robust deep learning pipeline 
          that can handle multiple satellite data sources across biomes and seasons.
        </p>

        <h2>Method Overview</h2>
        <p>
          My project drew from the <em>U-Net</em> family of CNN architectures, famous 
          for its success in medical imaging and remote sensing. However, I employed 
          specific modifications to meet production constraints and further improve 
          consistency over time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Preparation &amp; Augmentation:</strong> 
            I used a "temporal augmentation" trick, ensuring multiple 
            satellite images captured at different dates fed the same label 
            (with refined confidence). This step helped train the model to 
            remain robust against changing vegetation cycles and atmospheric effects.</li>

          <!-- Add temporal augmentation example -->
          <figure class="article-figure">
            <img src="assets/images/montage.png" alt="Temporal augmentation example showing satellite images across different dates">
            <figcaption>Example of temporal augmentation: The same area captured across different dates (10/08 to 12/02) showing varying atmospheric conditions. 
            Top row shows raw satellite imagery, bottom row shows the annotation confidence used during training for tree/shrub classification. 
            Training on multiple temporal views helps the model become robust to atmospheric interference.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <li><strong>Specialized Inputs:</strong> 
            Beyond the standard RGB and near-infrared bands, I included 
            derived indices (like NDVI, NDMI) and SRTM30-based elevation 
            data to add extra context. This proved helpful for challenging 
            distinctions such as Crops vs. Grass, or Trees vs. Shrubs.</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight Architecture:</strong> 
            I built a minimal U-Net variant with only three downsampling 
            levels, plus carefully chosen enhancements like attention gates 
            or atrous spatial pyramid pooling. This balanced inference 
            speed (for large-scale production) and accuracy.</li>
          <li><strong>Global Reach &amp; Satellite Agnosticism:</strong>
            By systematically normalizing data from <em>Sentinel-2</em>, 
            <em>Landsat-8</em>, and older Landsat missions, the model 
            remains flexible enough to be used for historical analyses 
            and near real-time applications.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interactive Slider Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          Below, you can see how the model transforms a raw Sentinel-2 
          input (left side) into a land cover classification (right side). 
          Drag the slider to compare the images.

        <h2>Results &amp; Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>
          My approach was tested across multiple biomes—from temperate forests 
          to tropical regions—totaling 14 major ecoregions. Our final model achieved 
          strong performance metrics with 46.9% accuracy, 31.8% IoU (Intersection over Union), 
          and 75.1% MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). Most importantly, these results 
          remained consistent across different biomes—a crucial feature for Kayrros, 
          whose assets span diverse geographical regions worldwide. While our metrics 
          remained slightly below Google Dynamic World's performance, we successfully 
          built a lightweight and temporally consistent alternative.
        </p>

        <h2>Impact &amp; Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This internship project at Kayrros resulted in a production-ready 
          deep learning pipeline for reliable land cover mapping. By leveraging 
          smart data augmentation, additional satellite indices, and a lightweight 
          architecture, the solution demonstrated strong temporal consistency 
          across diverse geographies.

          <figcaption>Left: Land cover classification showing forest (dark green), grasslands (light green), and other vegetation types.

          to detect and date deforestation events.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The model proved particularly effective for deriving dynamic indicators 
          such as deforestation alerts, agricultural expansion, and other 
          environmental monitoring applications. While not quite matching 
          Dynamic World's accuracy, our approach offered improved temporal 
          consistency and multi-satellite compatibility.
