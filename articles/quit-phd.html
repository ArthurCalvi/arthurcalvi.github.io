        <p>I just attended the final session of Entrepreneur First's AI StartUp School 2025. My decision to quit my PhD was made a few months ago, but a conversation I had with Matéo Petel during this event convinced me of the importance of putting my decision into writing. As Matéo said, writing is a powerful act—one that allows us to glimpse someone else's mind. His words resonated deeply with me and shifted my perspective on writing, which had been distorted by my experiences in research. I'd forgotten the essence of why we write and read in the first place. So, thank you, Matéo.</p>

        <p>To understand my decision, we need to go back to the beginning—when I first signed my PhD contract. I had just graduated from MVA, one of the most prestigious masters in AI in France. I completed my internship at Kayrros, an innovative company specializing in remote sensing intelligence, working on biomass projects using satellite imagery and deep learning models (U-net). At the end of this internship, I had a choice: a full-time position at Kayrros or pursuing a PhD on a similar topic. At that time, I wanted to explore deeper technical challenges and commit to a long-term project. The PhD opportunity seemed perfect: a collaboration between two renowned labs, LSCE and INRIA, closely related to my previous work at Kayrros. Together, with my supervisors, we defined a compelling research topic: detecting, segmenting, and classifying forest disturbances using satellite imagery.</p>
        
        <p>Initially, the PhD began well. Within six months, I had made significant progress, met researchers across Europe, and even presented my work to researchers at NASA. However, after these first successful months, I began encountering major obstacles—particularly around data availability. Being split between two teams also became problematic; INRIA was deeply theoretical, focusing primarily on mathematics, while LSCE specialized in climate science. I didn't fully belong to either. To overcome this, I spent time at Kayrros to leverage their engineering expertise.</p>
        
        <p>This led me to reflect on whether strong engineering skills might be more crucial in this field than pure research skills. Handling extensive and diverse datasets without proper pipelines required significant engineering effort. Six months into my PhD, I found myself spending most of my time solving data-related engineering problems instead of doing actual research. I rationalized this as part of the PhD journey, reassured by weekly updates to my supervisors, who seemed satisfied with my progress.</p>
        
        <p>Then, a turning point occurred after my first PhD year when I experienced a breakup and lost my housing in Paris, forcing me back to Marseille temporarily—or so I thought. The harsh Parisian housing market extended my stay in Marseille longer than expected. Initially, I enjoyed reconnecting with family and sunshine, away from Parisian pressures. However, the physical distance from my teams exacerbated existing frustrations: I had no collaboration, and my first article was stalled by data limitations. My efforts to circumvent data scarcity by developing new methods became overwhelming and beyond my intended scope.</p>
        
        <p>In retrospect, I felt deeply disappointed by the lack of early supervision. I wish my supervisors had clearly communicated these foreseeable challenges—particularly data scarcity—beforehand. I realize now my PhD topic was insufficiently planned and lacked necessary groundwork. I was also angry with myself for assuming prestigious supervisors guaranteed success, and for believing their silence indicated satisfaction.</p>
        
        <p>To cope with these frustrations, I started freelancing and found joy in practical, result-oriented work. Eventually, I asked my supervisors for a year-long break to pursue entrepreneurship through a program like Entrepreneur First. They refused, fearing I'd never return. The ultimatum was clear: stop immediately or finish the PhD. Reluctantly, I decided to continue.</p>
        
        <p>Motivated once again, I temporarily set aside my stalled first article to focus on a simpler second one. Progress was swift until I encountered data quality issues again. This persistent challenge was deeply frustrating, particularly as our lab was only now—two years in—developing a functional pipeline for data access.</p>
        
        <p>Feeling exhausted and stuck, I traveled to Bali for a month, hoping a change of environment would help. It did. Upon my return, reinvigorated, I moved back to Paris determined to finish my PhD. However, my optimism quickly faded when I discovered nothing had improved. I saw even less of my supervisors, felt no team cohesion, and ultimately reached a breaking point. I had seen joyful, fulfilled people in Bali; in comparison, the lifelessness of the lab environment felt unbearable.</p>
        
        <p>Initially, I felt intense anger toward research and researchers. I viewed them as dull, uninspired, and conservative. With time, however, I realized my issues stemmed from a misaligned environment and inadequate guidance—not from research itself. My supervisors failed to adequately structure the project, foresee obstacles, or guide me effectively from the start. Conversely, I entered a PhD without fully understanding my motivations or career goals. I didn't aim to become a researcher; I merely sought technical growth without a clear long-term plan.</p>
        
        <p>Deciding to quit my PhD was difficult—I wrestled with feelings of duty, courage, and determination. But the work was no longer rewarding, especially without genuine passion or meaningful support. Moving forward, I plan to complete my current article and thoroughly document my work, leaving behind a solid foundation for future researchers.</p>
        
        <p>I now believe that research can indeed be fulfilling—but only with the right team, clear objectives, and genuine passion. To anyone considering a PhD, my advice is straightforward: be absolutely sure of your passion and clear about your life goals. For me, this was not the right path, and now I am ready to explore new opportunities beyond academia.</p>
